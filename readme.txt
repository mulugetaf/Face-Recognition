After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19
 there arises a severe need of protection mechanisms, 
face mask being the primary one. 
The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on live streaming video as well as on images. 
We have used deep learning to develop our face detector model. 
The algorithm used for the object detection purpose is Haar-Cascade because of its good performance accuracy and high speed. 
Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. 
Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data.

=======================================
Highly recommended for high performance:
Graphics card and core i7

Requirements:
1. Download & install XAMPP Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl (phpMyAdmin).
2. Pip install TensorFlow x.2
3. Pip install Open CV
4. Pip install FaceRecognition
5. Pip install tkinter

Steps:
1. Register a new account.
2. Login.
* If you want to upload a folder with the objects photos skip to step 4.
* If you want to upload a single image skip to step 8.
3. Choose 'Normal Camera' to take new photos with live camera and create folder with the images on your computer (mask/no mask). 
4. Select folder from your computer with face images (mask/no mask). 
5. Choose 'Train' method from the dropdown â€“ The machine performs deep learning of the images (It will take some time) and click Run.
6. Choose 'Face Recognition' / 'Mask Detector' and test the machine and click Run
7. Select image with a face and wait for the machine to recognize.
8. Have fun!!!
